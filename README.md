# purescript-halogen-reactnative


A little bit of fun to see if I could get react native working with halogen.
I got a basic toggle button working.

## Running the example

```
> npm install -g react-native-cli
> npm install
> bower install
> npm run build-basic
> react-native start
> react-native run-ios
```
